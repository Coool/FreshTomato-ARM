############## Resolver settings ##############

## [CHANGE THIS] Short name of the resolver to use
## Usually the only thing you need to change in this configuratio file.
## This corresponds to the first column in the dnscrypt-resolvers.csv file.

ResolverName please-change-the-resolver-name-in-the-config-file


## Full path to the list of available DNSCrypt resolvers (dnscrypt-resolvers.csv)
## An up-to-date list is available here:
## https://download.dnscrypt.org/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv
## and the dnscrypt-update-resolvers.sh script can be used in order to
## automatically download and verify updates.

# ResolversList /usr/local/share/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv


## Manual settings, only for a custom resolver not present in the CSV file

# ProviderName    dnscrypt.resolver.example
# ProviderKey     E801:B84E:A606:BFB0:BAC0:CE43:445B:B15E:BA64:B02F:A3C4:AA31:AE10:636A:0790:324D
# ResolverAddress 203.0.113.1



############## Process options ##############

## Run the proxy as a background process

Daemonize no


## Write the PID number to a file

# PidFile /var/run/dnscrypt-proxy.pid


## [WINDOWS ONLY] The service name
## Multiple instances can run simultaneously, provided that they use
## distinct keys. The default service name is "dnscrypt-proxy".

# ServiceName dnscrypt-proxy


## [NOT AVAILABLE ON WINDWOS] Start the process, bind the required ports, and
## run the server as a less-privileged system user.
## The value for this parameter is a user name.

# User _dnscrypt-proxy



############## Network/protocol settings ##############

## Local address and port to listen to.
## A 127.0.0.x address is recommended for local use, but 0.0.0.0 or
## a specific interface address can be used on a router, or to
## configure a single machine to act as a DNS proxy for different
## devices.

# LocalAddress 127.0.0.1:53


## Creates a new key pair for every query.
## This prevents logging servers from correlating client public keys with
## IP addresses. However, this option implies extra CPU load, and is not
## very useful with trusted/non-logging servers.

EphemeralKeys off


## Maximum number of active requests waiting for a response.
## Keep it reasonable relative to the expected number of clients.

# MaxActiveRequests 250


## This is the maximum payload size allowed when using the UDP protocol.
## The default is safe, and rarely needs to be changed.

# EDNSPayloadSize 1252


## Ignore the time stamps when checking the certificates
## Do not enable this option ever, unless you know that you need it.

# IgnoreTimestamps no


## Do not send queries using UDP. Only use TCP.
## Even if some resolvers mitigate this, DNS over TCP is almost always slower
## than UDP and doesn't offer additional security.
## Only enable this option if UDP doesn't work on your network.

# TCPOnly no



############## Logging ##############

## Log the received DNS queries to a file, so you can watch in real-time what
## is happening on the network.
## The value for this parameter is a full path to the log file.

# QueryLogFile /tmp/dns-queries.log


## Log file to write server errors and information to.
## If you use this tool for privacy, keeping logs of any kind is usually not
## a good idea.

# LogFile /var/log/dnscrypt-proxy.log


## Don't log events with priority above this log level after the service has
## been started up. Default is 6.
## Valid values are between 0 (critical) to 7 (debug-level messages).

# LogLevel 6


## [NOT AVAILABLE ON WINDOWS] Send server logs to the syslog daemon
## Log entries can optionally be prefixed with a string.

# Syslog       off
# SyslogPrefix dnscrypt



############## Local filtering ##############

## If your network doesn't support IPv6, chances are that your
## applications are still constantly trying to resolve IPv6 addresses,
## causing unnecessary slowdowns.
## This causes the proxy to immediately reply to IPv6 requests,
## without having to send a useless request to upstream resolvers, and
## having to wait for a response.

BlockIPv6 no


## Want to filter ads, malware, sensitive or inapropriate web sites and
## domain names? This feature can block lists of IP addresses and names
## matching a list of patterns. The list of rules remains private, and
## the filtering process directly happens on your own network. In order
## to filter IP addresses, the list of IPs has to be put into a text
## file, with one IP address per line. Lists of domain names can also be
## blocked as well. Put the list into a text file, one domain per line.
## Domains can include wildcards (*) in order to match patterns. For
## example *sex* will match any name that contains the sex substring, and
## ads.* will match anything starting with ads. The Internet has plenty
## of free feeds of IP addresses and domain names used for malware,
## phishing and spam that you can use with this feature.
##
## To enable, uncomment one of the following definitions:

## Block query names matching the rules stored in that file:
# BlackList domains:/etc/dnscrypt-blacklist-domains.txt

## Block responses whose IP addresses match IPs stored in that file:
# BlackList ips:/etc/dnscrypt-blacklist-ips.txt

## Block both domain names and IP addresses:
# BlackList domains:/etc/dnscrypt-blacklist-domains.txt ips:/etc/dnscrypt-blacklist-ips.txt

## Same as the above + log the blocked queries in a file.
# BlackList domains:/etc/dnscrypt-blacklist-domains.txt logfile:/var/log/dnscrypt-blocked.log
# BlackList ips:/etc/dnscrypt-blacklist-ips.txt logfile:/var/log/dnscrypt-blocked.log
# BlackList domains:/etc/dnscrypt-blacklist-domains.txt ips:/etc/dnscrypt-blacklist-ips.txt logfile:/var/log/dnscrypt-blocked.log



############## User identification ##############

## Use a client public key for identification
## By default, the client uses a randomized key pair in order to make tracking
## more difficult. This option does the opposite and uses a static key pair, so
## that DNS providers can offer premium services to queries signed with a known
## set of public keys. A client cannot decrypt the received responses without
## also knowing the secret key.
## The value for this property is the path to a file containing the secret key,
## encoded as a hexadecimal string. The corresponding public key is computed
## automatically.

# ClientKey /etc/dnscrypt-client-secret.key



############## Monitoring ##############

## Do not actually start the proxy, but check that a valid certificate can be
## retrieved from the server and that it will remain valid for the specified
## time period. The process exit code is 0 if a valid certificate can be used,
## 2 if no valid certificates can be used, 3 if a timeout occurred, and 4 if a
## currently valid certificate is going to expire before the given margin.
## Useful in a cron job to monitor your own dnscrypt-servers.
## The margin is specified in minutes.

# Test 2880
